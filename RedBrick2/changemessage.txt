
1) Added another color to indicate orphans.
2) Reporting more internal errors to myself.
3) Narrowed COM visibility.
4) Got rid of some unused vars.
5) Address or suppressed bits that caused compiler warnings.
6) Changed font; maybe Ken's computer doesn't like Segoe UI. Let's go with default. Also calling .Update() superfluously to (perhaps) address the same problem.
7) Show top buttons, even if documents are closed.
8) Up/Down arrow keys can be used on the ECR viewer to page through ECRs.
