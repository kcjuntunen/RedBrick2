
1. Added a search by description function to "Drawings" window.
2. Handled some potential wildcard weirdness in "Drawings" window.
3. Click-copy now can be turned off if you'd rather have it that way.
4. Added a function to set metal borders to "Tool Chest".
5. Added a button to "Create Cutlist" for mass property setting.
6. CTRL+C weirdness is back. Everything just works better with it than without it.
