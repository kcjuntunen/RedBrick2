
1) Moved top buttons to their own panel.
2) Dimension suggestions come from the available dimensions in a model, rather than a static list.
3) Added the Drawing Collector to the RedBrick Toolbox (THE OLD ONE IS NOW DEPRECATED!)
4) Fixed a bug in the ECR viewer that caused it to crash if an ECR affected multiple revs of the same item.
5) When adding a new LVL, the "Description" field will now be pre-filled with whatever you typed in there last during the current session.
