
1) Updated PDF archiver so that useful information is redacted from a certain customer's drawings and sent to the profile folder.
2) Added UID to ECR data so we can tell JB's apart on ECRs too.
3) Fixed regex so Redbrick doesn't over-match McMaster-Carr items.
4) Match customer item numbers as much as possible with internal item numbers for the top groupbox in drawing view.
